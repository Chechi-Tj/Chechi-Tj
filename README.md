# About Me
## Hi, I'm Tejinder 👋
I'm a biologist exploring the intersection of data science, AI, and scientific imaging across multiple domains.

My current interests span:
-  AI/ML for complex biological systems
-  Computer vision (for species identification, microscopy, and biomedical imaging)
- Ecological & biodiversity data science
- Scientific image analysis workflows
- Open-source tools for research automation

I use this GitHub to document my learning, experiments, and early-stage research prototypes.
Everything here is work-in-progress — exploratory, iterative, and open.

### ⚒️ Current Projects (early stage)
- MOTAI — early-stage computer vision + automation tools for analysing model organisms
- eco-ml-toolbox — ML experiments on ecological + environmental datasets
- species-distribution-models-basics — foundational SDM workflows
- deep-learning-for-species-images — computer vision on open biodiversity datasets

More updates coming soon as I continue developing across ecology, AI, and engineering-driven biology.
